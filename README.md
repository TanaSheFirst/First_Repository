# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of funding received by Indian startup. The primary objective is to uncover underlying patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the data through various statistical and visualization techniques.

## Dataset Information

- **Dataset Source**: We merged 4 datasets, 1 from Github, 2 from a database and 1 from google drive

- **Description**: Data columns included company name, what the company does, year startup was founded, investors, founding amount received etc

- **Target Variable (if applicable)**: [Name of target variable]

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE that supports `.ipynb` files
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, etc.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and start exploring:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the EDA process.
- `images/`: Visualization images generated during EDA.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the project.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Handling missing values**: Describe the approach taken (e.g., imputation, dropping rows/columns).
- **Outlier Detection**: Any steps taken to remove or treat outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Any new features derived from the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Key steps performed in the EDA include:

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analysis of individual variables.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analysis of relationships between two variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Exploring the interactions between multiple variables.
- **Data Visualizations**: 
    - Distribution plots
    - Correlation matrix
    - Pair plots
    - Heatmaps

## Key Findings

- Highlight the main insights derived from the EDA process, such as:
  - Significant correlations between variables
  - Trends and patterns in the data
  - Anomalies or outliers identified

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
